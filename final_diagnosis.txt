--- Cardiologist Report ---
Possible Causes of Symptoms:

Given the patient's symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, feeling of impending doom) occurring in episodes, despite normal ECG, echocardiogram, and largely normal Holter monitor results, the most likely possibilities are:

1. **Panic Disorder/Anxiety Attack:** The frequency, duration, and associated symptoms strongly suggest panic disorder, exacerbated by the patient's pre-existing anxiety and high-stress lifestyle.  The occasional PVCs on the Holter monitor are common in healthy individuals and likely benign in this context.

2. **Cardiac Arrhythmia (subtle):** While the 24-hour Holter showed only occasional PVCs,  more subtle arrhythmias, such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, could be responsible for the episodes and might not be consistently captured on a 24-hour Holter.

3. **GERD-related Chest Pain:** Although the patient is on PPIs, it's worth considering atypical GERD presentations mimicking cardiac symptoms, especially given the concurrent anxiety.

Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Extended Cardiac Monitoring:** A longer-duration Holter monitor (e.g., 48 hours or even a 7-day monitor) or an implantable loop recorder (ILR) is warranted to capture any intermittent, subtle arrhythmias that might be causing the episodes.

2. **Stress Test:**  A graded exercise stress test (or pharmacological stress test if exercise contraindicated) could be considered to evaluate for inducible ischemia, although the normal ECG and echocardiogram make this less likely.

3. **Further Evaluation of Anxiety:**  A thorough evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist is recommended to optimize the management of the patient's anxiety.  This might involve adjustments to CBT therapy, medication management (consider exploring alternatives if needed), and stress-reduction techniques.

4. **Repeat GERD Assessment:** Review the patient's GERD control; it may be worthwhile to reassess medication efficacy and/or lifestyle modifications.  A 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring study might be indicated if the symptoms do not adequately respond to optimized PPI therapy.

5. **Consider Esophageal Manometry:** Should the other avenues prove fruitless, this would help rule out motility issues that might cause chest pain mimicking cardiac issues.


Only after these investigations are completed can a definitive diagnosis be made, and an appropriate management plan can be fully implemented.

**Possible Mental Health Issues:**

* **Panic Disorder:** The described episodes of intense chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, and fear of impending doom strongly suggest panic attacks.  The frequency and duration align with diagnostic criteria.  While the medical workup ruled out cardiac causes, the anxiety history and current symptoms point towards a panic disorder diagnosis.
* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):**  Given the patient's family history of GAD and prior diagnosis, it's likely he continues to experience underlying generalized anxiety, even with CBT and medication. The high-stress job exacerbates this.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

* **Referral to a psychiatrist or therapist specializing in anxiety disorders:**  A comprehensive evaluation for panic disorder and GAD is crucial. This will involve a thorough assessment of symptoms, triggers, and coping mechanisms.
* **CBT Therapy:**  Continue or resume CBT, focusing on panic management techniques (e.g., relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, exposure therapy).  This should be tailored to address both panic attacks and underlying GAD.
* **Medication Review:** The psychiatrist should review the current lorazepam usage.  While helpful for acute anxiety, long-term reliance on benzodiazepines is generally discouraged.  They might consider alternative or augmenting medications such as an SSRI or SNRI, potentially in conjunction with a low dose of a beta-blocker for somatic symptoms if the panic continues.
* **Lifestyle Modifications:**  Address lifestyle factors that contribute to anxiety. This includes stress management techniques (e.g., mindfulness, yoga), regular exercise, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, and potentially exploring strategies to mitigate work-related stress.
* **Psychoeducation:**  Educating the patient about panic disorder and GAD, dispelling misconceptions about their physical symptoms, and empowering him with self-management strategies is vital.

It is important to note that these recommendations are based solely on the provided report and do not constitute a formal diagnosis or treatment plan. A comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional is essential.

Possible Respiratory Issues:  None directly identified.  The patient's chief complaint and reported symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating) point towards a cardiac or anxiety-related etiology, not a primary respiratory condition.  The clear breath sounds on respiratory exam further support this.

Recommended Next Steps: While a primary respiratory issue is unlikely based on the provided data, the patient's anxiety significantly impacts his symptoms.  Therefore, optimizing his anxiety management is crucial.  This could involve:

* **Referral to a Cardiologist:** Although cardiac workup has been largely negative, the combination of chest pain and anxiety warrants a cardiology consultation to rule out any subtle cardiac issues completely.
* **Anxiety Management Optimization:**  Consider increasing the frequency or dosage of CBT sessions, potentially exploring additional anxiety management techniques like meditation or mindfulness.  Review his Lorazepam use â€“ ensure it's used judiciously and not masking underlying issues.
* **Stress Reduction Strategies:**  Address the high-stress job.  Encourage stress reduction techniques such as exercise, yoga, or time management strategies.
* **Cardiac monitoring (optional):** Depending on the cardiologist's recommendation,  consider an extended Holter monitor or event recorder to better capture infrequent events.


No pulmonary function tests or imaging studies are indicated at this time based on the presented information.

--- Multidisciplinary Team Summary ---
* **Panic Disorder:** The consistent reporting of panic attack symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, feeling of impending doom) across all three reports, coupled with the patient's history of anxiety and a high-stress lifestyle, strongly suggests this diagnosis.  The largely negative cardiac and pulmonary workups further support this as the primary diagnosis.

* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):**  The patient's family history of GAD, prior diagnosis, and ongoing high-stress job significantly increase the likelihood of co-occurring GAD.  The symptoms experienced are consistent with GAD, and managing this underlying anxiety is critical for alleviating the panic attacks.

* **Subtle Cardiac Arrhythmia:** While initial cardiac tests were largely unremarkable, the persistence of symptoms despite normal findings warrants further investigation.  The cardiologist's recommendation for extended cardiac monitoring acknowledges the possibility of subtle arrhythmias (like PSVT or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) that might not be detected on standard tests.  These arrhythmias could be responsible for triggering the patient's panic attacks and somatic symptoms.
